Here's a list of books that I thoroughly enjoyed. I highly recommend them to everyone who agrees with some of my views. They are scattered all over the genres, but fuck genres! The most important thing is that these books are awesome!

<h2>The Filter Bubble</h2>

<div>
<img style="float: right; height: 300px;" src="http://d20eq91zdmkqd.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/large/9781/1015/9781101515129.jpg">

<ul>
    <li><strong>Author:</strong> Eli Pariser</li>
    <li><strong>Genre:</strong> Technology</li>
    <li><strong>Year of publishing:</strong> 2012</li>
    <li><strong>ISBN-10 / ISBN-13:</strong> 0143121235 / 978-0143121237</li>
</ul>

<p>This book was scary. Like, exceptionally scary. Eli Pariser (now a CEO of <a href="http://www.upworthy.com/">Upworthy</a>) did an amazing job of letting us know how personalization could ruin the Web as we know it.</p>

<p>This book is full of excellent quotes and reading it left a strong mark on me. I really <em>did</em> reconsider how I use the Internet after reading it.</p>

<p>Now the most scary part of this book is that it was written in 2012, and most of the things that the book thought of being in our near future is already a part of our present and a part of our recent past. Let us all hope that the battle still isn't lost.</p>

<h2>The Armageddon Rag</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Author:</strong> George R.R. Martin</li>
    <li><strong>Genre:</strong> Fantasy</li>
    <li><strong>Year of publishing:</strong> 2007</li>
    <li><strong>ISBN-10 / ISBN-13:</strong> 0553383078 / 978-0553383072</li>
</ul>

<p>This book is my favorite by George R.R. Martin (the author of mega-popular A Song of Ice and Fire series). In it, George did an amazing job of letting me, as a member of younger generation, experience what was it like living in the eighties.</p>

<p>The book has some mild fictive elements, but they did not ruin the overall reading experience. In fact, they did just the opposite, letting you glide into the story even further and wondering what will happen next.</p>

<h2>Goodbye Sarajevo</h2>

<div>
<img style="float: right; height: 300px;" src="https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1347779423l/11527308.jpg">

<ul>
    <li><strong>Author:</strong> Atka Reid, Hana Schofield</li>
    <li><strong>Genre:</strong> Historical non-fiction</li>
    <li><strong>Year of publishing:</strong> 2012</li>
    <li><strong>ISBN-10 / ISBN-13:</strong> 9781408814567 / 978-1408814567</li>
</ul>

<p>Reading this book is emotionally hard. It was especially difficult for me, because I was born in Serbia near the end of the war and I moved to Sarajevo two months ago. I'm working in the same neighborhood where the family lived, just 100 meters away from the hospital and 200 metres away from Holiday Inn.</p>

<p>I did my best to understand what was going in Sarajevo during the war, but nothing managed to explain the situation so clearly as this book did. It's kind of sad that this book is nearly impossible to get in Sarajevo.</p>

<p>Full of positive Bosnian references, this book is a very nice introduction to the Bosnian culture. I'm amazed by the quality of writing. It was so easy to get lost in the book and I have read it in two days. The chapters are equally sized and I kept saying to myself 'Just one more chapter". Before I realized, it was 6 AM and I have spent the entire night reading it.</p>

<p>I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to know what it looks like to live in a city that has been under the siege for years in a modern world. Stripped out of political motives, this was the best explanation of what my country looked like during the war.</p>

<h2>You're Never Weird on the Internet (Almost)</h2>

<div>
<img style="float: right; height: 300px;" src="http://d28hgpri8am2if.cloudfront.net/book_images/onix/cvr9781476785653/youre-never-weird-on-the-internet-almost-9781476785653_hr.jpg">

<ul>
    <li><strong>Author:</strong> Felicia Day</li>
    <li><strong>Genre:</strong> Autobiography/technology </li>
    <li><strong>Year of publishing:</strong> 2015</li>
    <li><strong>ISBN-10 / ISBN-13:</strong> 1476785651 / 978-1476785653</li>
</ul>

<p>This book was amazing! I had no idea who Felicia Day was before I grabbed a copy of this book (the book attracted me with its title). By the end of the book, I learned a lot about her and realized that she is freaking awesome!</p>

<p>She's one of the main actors in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of9kHpCv1ts">Dr Horrible's Sing-Along Blog</a> (together with Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion), AKA the most awesome video ever. She experienced a lot of crazy shit in her life and I was glad I had a chance of reading about that.</p>

<p>Now there is one chapter (second to the last if I remember correctly) about the Gamergate controversy that I... it's not like I didn't like it, it's just that... it felt like it was out of the place when compared to the rest of the book. While I do agree that the stuff she said had to be said, it kind of didn't go well with the rest of the book. But still, this has not influenced my opinion about the book a lot.</p>

<h2>The Boy Who Could Change the World: The Writings of Aaron Swartz</h2>

<div>
<img style="float: right; height: 300px;" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51waG0MoAAL._SX334_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg">

<ul>
    <li><strong>Authors:</strong> Aaron Swartz,  Lawrence Lessig</li>
    <li><strong>Genre:</strong> Autobiography/technology </li>
    <li><strong>Year of publishing:</strong> 2016</li>
    <li><strong>ISBN-10 / ISBN-13:</strong> 162097066X / 978-1620970669</li>
</ul>

<p>I have always admired Aaron Swartz. In fact, if I ever listed my top influences (well, technically, <a href="https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/notes/blob/master/01_people-i-admire.md">I did</a>) he would be in the top three people that influenced my life.</p>

<p>Of course, most of the book is actually filled with copies of his blog posts (still available at <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/">aaronsw.com</a>) and I've been meaning to read through his blog for over a year, but never had enough time to do so. This book proved to be a perfect way to actually read some of his most important blog posts and it was filled with a couple of posts that were deleted and two transcripts of his talks, which made it even more awesome.</p>

<p>It's a shame that we lost such a great guy in such a tragic way. It's up to us to continue where he left off and do our best to make the Internet a beautiful place. I can't recommend this book enough. RIP Aaron, you truly are missed.</p>

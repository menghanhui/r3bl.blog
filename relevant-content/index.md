This blog does not serve ads in any single way. Instead of that, it shows you a relevant "ad" of some project I support. The image is generated randomly and the script that generates it does not track you in any single way.

Even though I am affiliated with some of these projects, I am not getting paid for displaying them. This is just my way of promoting the things that I like.

## List of projects that are shown in the "ads"

As the owner of this website, I do my best to protect the privacy of you as my visitor whenever it makes sense to do so.

* I self-host whatever makes sense to self-host.
* I make sure that my website loads fast.
* I don't serve ads. Instead, [I promote projects I support](https://r3bl.blog/en/relevant-content/).
* I make sure that my website doesn't make unnecessary connections outside of the domains I control.
* The website and its assets are hosted from a dedicated server in Germany (and as such operates under EU jurisdiction).
* I only load content from third parties when it is necessary to do so, and make sure to use privacy modes when embedding if possible.
* I use a third-party analytics service that respects [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) header and is easily blockable by every popular adblocker.

## Applies to

This privacy policy applies to the following domains:

* [r3bl.me](https://r3bl.me)
* [r3bl.blog](https://r3bl.blog)
* [r3bl.dj](https://r3bl.dj)
* [r3bl.tech](https://r3bl.tech) (Release TBA)
* [netneutralnost.com](https://netneutralnost.com)

## Analytics service

The third-party service I'm using is called [Clicky](https://clicky.com/). In a nutshell:

* It's not Google Analytics.
* It's easy to block using popular adblockers.
* It is configured in such a way that it respects [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) preference.
* The tracking script loads asynchronously; the content is more important then for me to track you.

**What I do with data:** I use them to track where the visitors are coming from, what are they visiting, how long are they using the website, and what kind of a device are they using to access the website. I collect very minimal, easily avoidable insight in order to improve the speed of the website and to have some general idea as to how far my word reaches.

**What Clicky does with data:** Clicky aggregates anonymized data for the purposes of generating reports (such as the [browser marketshare report](https://clicky.com/marketshare/global/web-browsers/)). It does not have the authority to further sell the data nor use it for any other purpose.

**What are my future plans:** Since I'm already self-hosting pretty much everything, it's only a question of time before I deploy a self-hosted version of the analytics service, such as ~~~Piwik~~~Matomo. Unfortunately, hosting stuff is complicated, requires constant maintenance, and managing analytics data is not an easy task as well. So, the switch to a completely self-hosted site will happen sometime, but I cannot give a time estimate on that. Meanwhile, I'm using the most privacy-aware third-party analytics service I could find.

## What I don't do on this website

* I do not nor have I ever sold any collected data.
* I do not nor have I ever used this site to serve ads. [I promote projects I support](https://r3bl.blog/en/relevant-content/) instead.
* I do not mine cryptocurrencies.
* I have never hosted sponsored content on any of my website. If I ever decide to do so in the future, sponsored content will be easy to distinguish.
* I do not use Google Analytics, Google Fonts, Google's CDN, etc.
* I do not use Google's AMP program. I'm one of the signatories of the [Letter about Google AMP](http://ampletter.org/).
* I do not make any connections to Facebook what so ever. You have to explicitly click on a button or a link for your browser to make connections to Facebook's servers.

## What I do to make my content easy and secure to consume

* I make my websites as fast and as minimalistic as possible.
* I focus on the content first. Everything else gets out of the way.
* I carefully structure my data so that it's easily recognizable to scrapers and search engines.
* I only load static content, making my website as fast to load as possible.
* I make sure my articles look good using browser's reader mode and [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/).
* I use [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/), and Twitter Cards.
* My blog is available [over RSS](https://r3bl.blog/feed.xml). My RSS feed returns full articles (not just excerpts), making visitors able to read my content in its entirety using their favorite RSS reader.
* I use descriptive alt tags in images.
* If you have visual disability, I recommend reading my articles using [Pocket if you're on a smartphone](https://help.getpocket.com/article/1081-listening-to-articles-in-pocket-with-text-to-speech), or [Firefox's reader view if you're on a laptop/desktop](https://mzl.la/1cHarCP).

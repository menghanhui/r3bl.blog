Recently I finished a free course offered [Cyber Security School Online](http://www.cybersecurityschoolonline.com/) on [Udemy](http://udemy.com/) called [Build Your Own Cyber Lab from Home](https://www.udemy.com/build-your-own-cyber-lab-at-home/#/).

What I want to do now is to share the notes I've written while taking the course. The courses are divided into a couple of cathegories and they're written for my current knowledge and situation, but I hope that there will be a person out there that will find them useful.

Here are the links to [.odt version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By-yP9sfB84VTkhGX2g0N1VvLU0/edit?usp=sharing) and [.pdf version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By-yP9sfB84VZHA5Zjg4X096Yms/edit?usp=sharing).

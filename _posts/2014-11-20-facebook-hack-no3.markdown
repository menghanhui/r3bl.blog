I found out about one more basic Facebook hack. Let's say that you have a friend who locked his profile picture so that nobody could open it, but you want to see his profile picture in full size. Can you do that? Well, thanks to Facebook's constant concern about the privacy of its users... of course you can!

So, what you need to do? You just need to use this URL:

    https://graph.facebook.com/USERNAME/picture?width=800

Of course, you need to replace the string `USERNAME` with the actual username of the user. You can get that by just opening up that profile and checking the URL in your browser.

Of course, this works even if you don't have that person in your friends.

For the third time, thank you Facebook for carrying about us!

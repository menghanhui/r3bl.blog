Browsing through a [Google+ group](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/109586015108702871702) dedicated to Linux users in Serbia and Balkan region, I saw a post that linked a web page called [Why Microsoft](http://www.whymicrosoft.com/).

To be honest, I'm [not a Microsoft hater](http://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/08/05/confession-microsoft-is-not-so-bad/) even though I use [Kubuntu Linux distribution](http://kubuntu.org/) as my primary operating system. I've decided to check out that site just to see why Microsoft thinks their products are so much better than competitors products.

I took a few screenshots and I want to present to you Microsoft's marketing strategy.

As you can see in the pictures, Microsoft's strategy consists on deceiving users by comparing their software's compatibility with _their software_, some lies and some double standards.

So, I've got two primary cloud providers: [Mail.ru cloud](https://cloud.mail.ru/) and [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/). I've been using both of them for quite some time. Mail.Ru cloud supports Linux and gives 100 GB for free. They've also had a promo action that lasted for a month and anyone who clicked on a certain link got 1 TB for free. Yup, 1 TB of cloud storage absolutely free. The only problem: the interface is in Russian. Not a big deal and once you get a hang of where things are located using the app is quite easy. They support pretty much any platform you can think of and Linux integration (tried it on Kubuntu and elementary OS) as well as Windows integration works perfectly.

But, sometimes I just want to share my files with someone. I'm not sure if that is possible with Mail.Ru cloud, but I know a place where it is: Microsoft OneDrive. As I've explained before in [this post](http://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/08/05/confession-microsoft-is-not-so-bad/), I'm not a big Microsoft hater even though I'm a Linux user and I trust them [far more then I trust Google](http://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/08/08/mozilla-firefox-does-everyone-thing-of-it-just-as-an-alternative-to-chrome/). I have an Office 365 subscription for about a month or two and I got 20 GB of cloud storage because of that which, combining with 7 gigabytes for free
and synchronizing my Windows 8.1 sums up to 30 GB. Well, not so bad, but still, too far from 1 TB for free that I got on my other cloud service.

But, recently, Microsoft [lowered the price](http://mashable.com/2014/06/23/onedrive-price-cuts/) of their storage and I also got 1 TB for free using OneDrive thanks to my Office 365 subscription.

So, how to integrate OneDrive with Linux? Well, I did try to use OneDrive-D but I got a strange error which I'm not capable of fixing, so I decided to find some other solution, and I did manage to do so.

The service is called Storage Made Easy, it offers free account where you can add up to three cloud providers and it supports Linux nativelly with it's free aplication.

To sum things up, I've got 2 TB of cloud storage by practially paying nothing, and I have no idea what the hell am I supposed to do with that much of a storage.

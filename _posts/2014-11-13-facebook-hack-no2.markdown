As I've already said [in my previous post](https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/11/13/facebook-hack-no1/), In this blog post series I’m going to share with you some useful Facebook “hacks”.

Lets say that you have some mobile numbers but you don't know the who's the owner of this number? Well luckily, Facebook allows you to search users by their mobile number, so all you have to do is to enter that phone number in Facebook's search bar. There is absolutely no way for you to disable that what so ever.

It's a lot easier to find someone if you have them as your friends, you'll get a lot more precise information that way because the default privacy setting for this is limited to friends only by default.

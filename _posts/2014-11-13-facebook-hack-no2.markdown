As I've already said [in my previous post](https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/11/13/facebook-hack-no1/), In this blog post series I’m going to post about some useful Facebook “hacks” that you can do without ever leaving Facebook at all. I will _not_ be using any external software, website or something similar while posting about this topic.

You have some mobile numbers but you don't know who's behind them? Well, Facebook automatically allows you to search users by their mobile number, so all you have to do is to enter that phone number in Facebook's search. There is absolutely no option for you to disable that what so ever.

It's a lot easier to find someone if you have them as your friends, you'll get a lot more exact information that way, because the default privacy setting for this is limited to friends only. You can also do this with an email address.

**A fun project**: Create an Android/iPhone/Windows Phone/FirefoxOS application. When someone unknown number calls you, the application opens up Facebook and enters that mobile number in Facebook's search and displays the top result to you, so you know who's calling you even if you don't have them inside your address book.

If you want to make this kind of application, please do let me know. I'm willing to use it and I'm willing to share it on my blog. I'm just lazy as fuck, so I won't be creating that application any time soon.

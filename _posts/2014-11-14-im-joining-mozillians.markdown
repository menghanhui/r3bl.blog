So, this is my second (or maybe even third?) time trying to join the Mozilla community. The previous attempts did not go as I thought they will, so I'm ready to start again. In my previous attempt I tried to contact my local Mozilla community, but they seem to be pretty inactive these days so that attempt didn't go too well. Anyway, it's time to try again.




**Why do I want to try again exactly?**




Well, it's been a couple of years since I started using Mozilla's service in every opportunity I get. I'm using Firefox and Thunderbird all of the time, I started chatting on IRC regularly (you can find me on [Freenode](http://www.freenode.org/) almost all of the time), I do have some kind of coding skills and thanks to [elementary OS](http://elementaryos.org/), I started to feel pretty confident in testing out beta software. Other than that, I do have a lot of translation experience, translating projects like [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/r3bl/), [The Tor Project](http://torproject.org/), [elementary OS](http://elementaryos.org/) (and all of the software it contains by default) and the list goes on and on. I also happened to have a lot of free time lately, so the only question is why shouldn't I help a project that's doing so much to help us who use free software regularly?




**So, what I will be doing then?**




I'm going to test out Mozilla's services as much as I can. I'm going to help my local team to translate all of the products to Bosnian language, and, if I start to feel confident enough, I'm going to start writing some code for Mozilla in my spare time.




**Come and join us!**




Come and join us at [mozillians.org](https://mozillians.org/en-US/)! You can find my freshly created profile there by visiting [this link](https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/aleksandar.todorovic/).




For the start, it's time for me to stop writing this blog post and check out my mail, join the Mozilla's IRC and so on and so on. I hope that this attempt is going to be much much better than my previous one and that I'm going to start contributing to Mozilla on a regular basis.

So, I started my college education last October. First semester I wasn't very good. I passed tree of five subjects I was supposed to pass and I got pretty much amazing grades in the subjects I did pass. But now, during the second semester, I started learning for my Cisco CCNA certificate. That certificate was the reason I decided to go on this collage (although, to be honest, my choice was very limited considering my financial situation at the time).

Now, I came to the end of the second semester. In my R&S course (first course in the path to CCNA certificate), I wasn't very active. I didn't go to all of the classes in that course I wasn't very regular in lab exercises. I did not study every week and I had more and more materials to learn. I knew that, but I just didn't pay attention. I took collage for granted and now I have a problem.

Tomorrow is my final test in my R&S course and I'm stuck. I did _try_ to study for it as much as I could in the last ten days. I managed to learn first eight chapters, but I got stuck during the chapter nine. I just can't understand subnetting and it's just a big pain in the butt for me. I lost my concentration and now I have no idea what to do. I studied that chapter yesterday. I've spent pretty much all of my day studying it and I still couldn't finish a basic subnetting in Packet Tracer. Now, I'm trying to do the same, but I just cannot concentrate at all. And, I still have two more chapter to go through after I finish this one.

Passing this exam is not going to be easy at all, but I will give my best. After all, being a cybersecurity specialist is my dream for a couple of years, and I just can't be that if I don't understand how networks actually work. This is going to be a long night.

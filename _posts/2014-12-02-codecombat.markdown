If you ever programmed in your life, you've probably realized that the process of learning a new programming language can become quite a boring thing to do. You already know how to program in X programming language, but you need to learn the syntax of Y language for yourself / for some new project / for some job you want to get? Well, believe it or not, there _is _a fun way to do that.




I was never a huge fan of video games, but I did like to play a game or two once every few days. I haven't played a single game for months now. I consider playing games as a huge procrastination. One of the main reasons I switched to Linux (almost completely now) is because I wanted to be more productive, and one of the ways to be more productive is to limit your access to the things that make you procrastinate*.




But, there's a certain game that got my attention. It's called [CodeCombat](http://codecombat.com/) and the point of playing this game is to teach you the syntax of a programming language in a very fun way. It's an open source project (and if you've been reading my blog you know how much am I obsessed by everything related to open source) and the game is not limited to one specific programming language. You can select which programming language you want to use. My choice for a new programming language was JavaScript. This is a pretty well done browser game, so you can start playing the game no matter what platform you're using currently.




Now I'm not in any way suggesting that this is the best way to learn some programming language, but it pretty much is the most fun way of doing that. So, if you like playing computer games, but you think that you're waisting your time by playing them instead of learning something, this game is pretty much the best of both worlds.

* DISCLAIMER: I'm not saying that gaming on Linux is not possible. I'm a huge fan of the way how Linux gaming is advancing in the last year or two. I'm just having a huge self control over it.

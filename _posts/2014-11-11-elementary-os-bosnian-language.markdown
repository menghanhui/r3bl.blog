So, apart from writing my first semi-professional paper (which I wrote about – although in Bosnian - [here](https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/10/28/da-li-su-dobri-muzicki-producenti-ujedno-i-dobri-psiholozi-eksperiment/)) and organizing a contest on my blog where you could win a couple of Office 365 licenses for free, I started to fall in love into programming again. It's been a couple of months since I programmed _anything_.

The last project I've been working on is working, but it has a hell of a lot of bugs. It's called Sensitive Data Grabber and I've already written about it on my blog [here](https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/08/03/sensitive-data-grabber-project/). So, why ain't I finishing it?

Well, the thing is that I've created that project using Visual Basic inside Visual Studio. You probably know that this kind of environment is Windows-specific. I've been spending most of my time lately using Linux as my primary operating system. I've found my perfect distribution and it's called elementary OS (I already covered the reasons why [here](https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/10/16/elementary-os-savrsena-distribucija-za-mene/) - again, in Bosnian language).

Now, because I don't have enough knowledge in any programming language that can be run in my perfect distribution, I'm still adjusting. While I'm doing that, I've decided that I want to do _something_ for the elementary community _before_ I'm good enough to program some apps. Because of that, I've decided to start translating elementary OS to Bosnian language.

I'm not just getting started, I've already finished translating a lot of elementary-related projects. Now I only have seven (out of 37) projects left. That's a little more than 2.5k strings to translate. It does seem like a lot, but I'm pretty confident that I will be able to finish that by the end of the year. Most of the operating system is already translated. By the time I finish it, I'll probably be able to program some useful apps and then I'll start to publish them using my own ppa.

I feel very optimistic right now. As the narrator says in the end of this great video:

_I don't know why, but.. I feel very excited about the future. Anything is possible now._

**Update:**

The translation of elementary OS is almost over! Only a couple of programs until you can use elementary OS without any problems if you come from Bosnia & Herzegovina!

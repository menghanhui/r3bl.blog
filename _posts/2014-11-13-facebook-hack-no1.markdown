In this blog post series I'm going to post about some useful Facebook "hacks" that you can do without ever leaving Facebook at all. I will _not_ be using any external software, website or something similar while posting about this.

Want to see who checks your profile the most, reads your stories and stuff like that? Well, Facebook automatically adds some points to an account for stuff like that and you can check out who's currently your biggest "stalker" by following the description described here. I recommend you to use Firefox, it's a lot easier to do this in Firefox than it is in Chrome.

1. Open up your Facebook's homepage.
2. Ctrl + U.
3. Ctrl + F. Type InitialChatFriendsList in the find bar.
4. After that string you'll see a long number inside "" that ends with -2. Copy that number _without_ -2 in the end.
5. Go to https://www.facebook.com/*pastethatnumberhere*
6. Voila!

If you're using Chrome, Ctrl + F in the page inspector does not work as you'd expected it to work so my suggestion is to copy the entire page source to your favorite text editor and search from there.

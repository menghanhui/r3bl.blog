## Basic info

* **Page views**: 86408

## Most popular blog posts

**Note**: I'm excluding generic pages (such as the homepage and the about page from this list). Blog posts are written in the following format: `Link to the post (number of pageviews)`.

1. [Razotkrivanje Zrinke K(asapić)]({{site.url}}/bs/zrinka-k/index.html) (16201)
2. [Reasons Why Windows is Not Ready For Desktop]({{site.url}}/en/why-windows-is-not-ready-for-desktop/) (6722)

4. [My elementary OS Workflow]({{site.url}}/en/elementary-os-workflow/index.html) (822)

10. [A year of Linux has already happened. You missed it.]({{site.url}}/en/year-of-linux/index.html) (405)

My very first Opensource.com article ([A beginner's guide to GitHub](https://opensource.com/life/15/2/beginners-guide-github?sc_cid=70160000000x3wTAAQ)) was named as the [top article of that week](https://opensource.com/life/15/2/top-5-articles-week-february-20), [top new article of that month](https://opensource.com/life/15/2/community-report-february-2015), [4th most popular article of the first half of 2015](https://opensource.com/life/15/6/top-25-articles-2015-so-far) and [11th most popular article in 2015](https://opensource.com/life/15/12/top-20-open-source-stories-2015).

## Have I achieved my goals?

A year ago when I wrote [blog stats for 2014]({{site.url}}/en/blog-stats-2014/), I listed a couple of goals for 2015. Six months later, when I realized that they are bullshit, I have [tweaked my goals]({{site.url}}/en/first-half-of-2015-stats/) a bit. Now, let's see if I have successfully completed them:

* `Number of views: 75,000` Yup. I even surpassed that goal by 11k.
* `Number of visitors: 50,000` Yup.
* `Number of published articles: 60` Yup. 42 on my blog and 20 on other websites.
* `Number of Twitter followers: 500` Nope. 381/500
* `Buying my own domain(s)` Yup. Perfectly happy with the domain I'm currently using.
* `Redesign of the blog` Nope. I was too lazy to do this.

## Goals for 2016

* **Number of pageviews**: 200,000
* **Number of visitors**: 150,000
* **Number of published articles**: 50
* **Number of Twitter followers**: 700
* **Number of published books**: 1 (yup, you've heard that right)

2016, here I come!

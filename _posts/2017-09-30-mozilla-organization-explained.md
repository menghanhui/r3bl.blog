# Making some sense out of inner workings of Mozilla

So, as a Ford-Mozilla Open Web Fellow, I've gained some insights about what Mozilla is, how it is divided, and what does it do. For me, the best way to absorb something I've learned is to write it down, so here's my attempt at figuring out what Mozilla is, what it does, what's Mozilla's mission and how does it try to reach that mission.

## Mozilla Foundation vs. Mozilla Corporation

In the simplest way I can put it, you should view Mozilla as two different entities:

* Mozilla Foundation - A non-profit organization whose job is mostly around advocacy.
* Mozilla Corporation - A fully-owned subsidiary of Mozilla Foundation whose core job is to develop technologies we all associate with the Mozilla brand (like Firefox).

## Mozilla Foundation and what it does

In the Mozilla Foundation's [manifesto](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/details/), there's a pledge at the end, that states that Mozilla will:

* build and enable open-source technologies and communities that support the Manifesto’s principles;
* build and deliver great consumer products that support the Manifesto’s principles;
* use the Mozilla assets (intellectual property such as copyrights and trademarks, infrastructure, funds, and reputation) to keep the Internet an open platform;
* promote models for creating economic value for the public benefit; and
* promote the Mozilla Manifesto principles in public discourse and within the Internet industry.

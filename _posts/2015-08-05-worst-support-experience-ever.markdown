I don't feel comfortable about publishing this blog post, but I feel obliged to do so.

Back in January, I've decided to move my blog to GitHub Pages + Jekyll combination. Since then, I'm spending a considerable amount of time using GitHub almost on a daily basis. Back then, I had also written a blog post which I titled [Reasons Why GitHub is My Favorite Technology-Related Company](https://r3bl.github.io/en/why-github-is-my-favorite-company/). Once I published it and re-read it a couple of times, I became confident enough in my blogging skills to have the story submitted to some other, more popular domain. I chose [Opensource.com](http://opensource.com/). It got accepted, went through the editorial process and became [A beginner's guide to GitHub](https://opensource.com/life/15/2/beginners-guide-github). The reactions I got to that post were mind blowing to me. It became [the most popular article of the week](https://opensource.com/life/15/2/top-5-articles-week-february-20), [the most popular new article posted in February](https://opensource.com/community-report-march-2015) and recently got named as the [4th most popular article published in the first half of 2015](https://opensource.com/life/15/6/top-25-articles-2015-so-far).

Now, let me quote myself from that article:

> ### Amazing support

> I'm a developer. I use lots of stable and unstable software and services on a daily basis, and it's important that I get support as fast as possible. I once had an issue with a GitHub feature and reached out to them for support. I received an email response within 20 minutes. Support was eventually able to explain exactly why I was having the issue and what I had to do to resolve it. I have to give them a straight 10/10 for their support.

I wasn't lying at all. My first support issue got resolved in less than an hour and I was perfectly happy with the support, which is why I have included this part in my article.

Somewhere in November (I think) I have sent a request to get a GitHub's [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/). The validation process lasted for a couple of months, but it got accepted. The main reason why I wanted to become the owner of that pack was because I wanted to get a free `.me` domain from Namecheap where I planned to move my blog.

It's not a problem to me to spend a couple of dollars to buy myself a domain. The problem is that I have a Maestro credit card, which is pretty much useless for any kind of online shopping. Because of that, I was looking forward to becoming an owner of this pack and getting a `.me` domain without going through the hassle of getting a new credit card.

Unfortunately, I mistyped my email address while I was using the unique link I got for Namecheap's registration process. I accidentally typed aleks**na**dar instead of aleks**an**dar in the email address field. It could happen to anyone, right? And so, my problems began.

Of course, I have never received a confirmation email. I tried going through the process again, but my unique link was no longer functioning. So, I contacted Namecheap's live support and asked them what should I do to fix this. They kindly suggested me to contact GitHub and ask them for a new unique link for this offer, which I did.

On May 15th, I have sent the following email to [education@github.com](mailto:education@github.com):

![1st email](http://i.imgur.com/j9jPTof.png)

Because of my first experience with GitHub's support, I expected to get a quick response, but the day has passed and my mailbox was empty. Then, five days have passed. Then, ten. Still not a freaking word from GitHub.

On May 27th, I tried pinging the same email address one more time. Again, no response. On June 6th, I tried again:

![3rd email](http://i.imgur.com/Q53VX0m.png)

Again, nothing.

On July 3rd, I tried again, but this time, I used my primary email address instead of the email address I got from my college and contacted [support@github.com](mailto:support@github.com) instead of [education@github.com](mailto:education@github.com).

![4th freaking email](http://i.imgur.com/y5b4eQZ.png)

Surely I should get a response now, right? _Again_, nothing.

All in all, 82 freaking days have passed and I haven't received any freaking email from GitHub about this issue. Not even an automatic one.

In the meantime, because of the response I got on my first Opensource.com article, I have decided to become a community moderator there. On June 1st, I've started my volunteering duty. Prior to OSCON, I interviewed Ben Balter from GitHub and learned some new things about the [current state of open source licensing at GitHub](https://opensource.com/life/15/7/interview-ben-balter-github). I thought about mentioning my support issue to him during our email conversation, but decided not to.

Last night, while I was browsing GitHub like I usually do, I stumbled upon an [AMA repository](https://github.com/mdo/ama) run by Mark Otto, another person working for GitHub. So, I [asked him a question](https://github.com/mdo/ama/issues/170).

_Finally_, 82 freaking days after I sent my first email, I got a freaking response from someone within GitHub! My issue is _still_ not resolved, but now at least _somebody_ replied to me and gave me hope that somebody _might_ look it up and freaking work on getting this issue resolved!

And so, what seemed like a pretty easy support issue that could be resolved in a matter of minutes turned out to be my worst customer support experience ever. During those 82 days, I could have gotten a new credit card _three times_ and bought like 15 domains from my allowance. And yet, here I am, still using a `.github.io` domain and hoping to get this issue resolved and _finally_ get a freaking domain for my blog. Fuck!

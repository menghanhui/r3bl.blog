First of all, sorry about the design of my previous post. I was trying Blogilo as a program for posting entries and the result was horrible! What I did is write down a post in LO Writer (need spelling while I write), copied it to Blogilo and clicked submit. The font was terrible, and I had to edit a post from a web interface because somewhere between my Blogilo and my blog some spaces just disappered!

Anyway, now I'm writing in QTM and I hope the post will be formated better before I write my next post in it.

I've been selected as one of the 40 students from the entire Europe who was invited to join #ICT2015 in Lisbon (Portugal) later this year. This is kind of a big news for me since this will be the first I(C)T conference that I'm going to attend.

## What is ICT 2015?

ICT 2015 is a conference organized by the Digital Agenda that is scheduled to be organized in the late October in Lisbon, Portugal. It's advertised as the biggest ICT conference that is going to be organized in the entire Europe this year with something like 4000-6500 people participating (if I remember correctly).

They were selecting 40 students who will join the conference. These 40 students will receive a free transportation to the event, accommodation, food, beverages... Pretty much every cost needed to participate is going to be covered by the organizers themselves. They selected me as one of those 40 students out of 250 that applied for this opportunity.

## How was I selected?

Basically, by working my ass off on my side projects. Every student had to promise to contribute to the conference in some way, and that's when my collaboration with sites like [Opensource.com](http://opensource.com), [Kompjuteraš](http://kompjuteras.com) etc. came into play. I already have like three or more higher profile sites where I can post my impressions and interview people.

Of course, contributing to some of the biggest open source projects out there definitely helped. Of course, none of my contributions are major ones. I didn't implement anything new to those projects, I just fixed a couple of smaller errors, translated a thing or two and things like that, but I made an impact on them. My contributions have been merged with these projects and that's the only thing that matters. I also included my volunteering experience in my application.

That's the thing. Being a student has not stopped me from doing something with my career already. I took a year off to participate in them but my risk is starting to pay off big time.

## I already got something in return for being selected

Although the conference is three months away, I already managed to get something in return from being selected as one of the participants. My college posted a blog post about me and my work (they already posted one blog post about me about a year before this). That post was also reposted probably the biggest news portal that shares news from my city and on one regional news source.

## What do I expect out of this conference?

Although I'm still two years away from my Bachelors degree in IT Engineering, I'm already starting my search in finding an internship opportunity abroad. I'm hoping to make some connections that are going to make my search even easier. There's probably going to be just a handful of biggest technology companies in the world attending it, but I don't care. I just want to find a company where I can grow professionally, apply my existing ICT knowledge and expand it.

At the beginning of this year, I set a goal to myself. I said that 2015 is going to be the year when I'm going to earn the opportunity to go to some foreign country and work or volunteer there. I didn't want to visit some new country as a tourist, I had a specific goal of what I'm planning to accomplish during my trip.

I already had a chance to spend a month in the Netherlands volunteering (I summarized my experience [here](https://r3bl.github.io/en/evs-netherlands-experience/)) and now I'm going to spend a couple of days in Portugal attending my very first conference and hopefully growing my professional career.

## The problem

There is just one problem with this. By joining [Opensource.com](http://opensource.com) I was automatically invited to join [All Things Open](http://allthingsopen.com/) in Red Hat's headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina. The problem is, that conference is going to be organized in the same week as ICT 2015. I'm not sure will I be able to organize my time to be able to attend both of these conferences, but I will do my best. With a bit of luck, I _should_ be able to do it. In any case, this is going to be _the_ craziest week in my life, but I'm ready for it.

ICT 2015, here I come!

So, Internet of Things is happening. More and more things are connected to the internet every day. What about securing the Internet of Things? This great presentation by [@securityweekly](https://twitter.com/securityweekly) covered most of the problems. And I laughed a lot while reading it. Too bad I can't listen to him explaining it in details.

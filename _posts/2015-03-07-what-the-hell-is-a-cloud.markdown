[OpenWay.si](http://openway.si/) is a conference organized in Novo mesto (Slovenia), promoting open source mentality in different areas. This is their 5th year they're organizing a conference and it will probably be their biggest conference so far. They're currently looking for sponsors and speakers, and if you're interested in helping them, you can apply too.

## Call for Speakers

If you think that you have an interesting topic related to open source mentality that you would like to share with a wider audience of people, I suggest you to apply your presentation (or a workshop) to [info@openway.si](info@openway.si). Your application must include your full name, an email address where you can be reached at in any time, your short biography, the title of your presentation and a short description of your presentation (and by short I mean below 300 words). While creating your presentation, please keep in mind that presentations will be 30 minutes long.

Application deadline: 24th of March, 2015.

## Call for Sponsors

If you would like to sponsor Open Way, please contact them on the same email address ([info@openway.si](info@openway.si)). You can donate your time, your money or other materials that could help them in the organization of their conference. By doing so, your company will gain visibility and you will prove that you are supporting open source mentality (which could increase your sales quite a bit).

Application deadline: 24th of March, 2015.

## More Information

For more information, visit [their website](http://openway.si/) or check out how their last conference went [here](http://2014.openway.si/).

Unfortunately, I won't be able to attend this conference since I will be volunteering in The Netherlands at that time as a part of the European Volunteering Service (more on that in a few days). But, I highly recommend you to support this conference, and, if you think you can manage that, help them out a bit.

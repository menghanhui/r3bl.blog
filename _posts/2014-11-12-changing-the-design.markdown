I feel pretty cyberpunk-ish lately so I've decided to change the whole look of three most important things to me: my blog, my Twitter account and my desktop.

I'm really feeling this concept art by a great artist called [Andree Wallin](http://andreewallin.com/). The art I like the most is called [Headphones](http://andreewallin.deviantart.com/art/Headphones-346542540) so I've decided to use it as my main inspiration for the design. So this is how my desktop looks like right now:

So what I did is I changed the background and then started to edit my Gtk theme and [Purple Rain](http://speedracker.deviantart.com/art/Purple-Rain-Conky-485091413) Conky configuration file. I did loose a couple of hours doing that, but I'm pretty satisfied with it right now and I'm getting a lot of positive feedback all over Google+ and Reddit for it.

Next thing I freshened up the design of my blog. So I've changed the theme and customized it a little. Hope this design works better for you. If not, contact me of course.

My Twitter is also re-designed, which means I basically only changed my avatar, header photo and the colour scheme, so I don't have a lot to talk about that.

Oh, and the [translation of elementary OS](https://aleksandartodorovic.wordpress.com/2014/11/11/elementary-os-bosnian-language/) is going great! Although, I have to admit that I'm not a huge fan of Launchpad as a tool for the translation of such a big project.
